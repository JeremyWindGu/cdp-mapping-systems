Historic Building footprint point consists of interior-placed centroid locations for structures that have been demolished or significantly altered. Attributes are identical to the polygon version of historic building footprints. Additional attribute information maintained for each feature includes: Building Identification Number (BIN); Borough, Block, and Lot information(BASE_BBL and MAPPLUTO_BBL); ground elevation at building base; roof height above ground elevation; construction year; demolition year; GLOBAL ID, and feature type.</abstract><purpose>This feature class is used by the NYC OTI GIS group to retain a record of building footprints removed from the NYC building footprints feature class.</purpose><supplinf>Update Frequency:
Features are updated daily by OTI staff and a public release is available weekly on NYC Open Data.

TemporalCoverage
The data includes building footprints that were demolished or altered back to 1991. Updates are added as information is processed by the editors.

PositionAccuracy (same as for building footprints)
Estimated positional accuracy for photogrammetrically updated features (those with GEOM_SOURCE = Photogrammetric) is +/- 2 feet and meets ASPRS Class 1 horizontal mapping standards and ASPRS vertical Class 2 accuracy specifications.  The mapping standards deal with Root Mean Square (RMS) calculations that states if a random number of clearly identifiable surveyed ground control points throughout the project were compared to the mapped features, the RMS of the points would not exceed 2'. In layman's terms,  95% of the data is accurate to +/- 2'.
&lt;br&gt;Features with GEOM_SOURCE = Other (Manual) are captured by heads-up digitizing using the most current orthophotography available (currently from Spring 2018). These will be somewhat less accurate than the photogrammetrically updated features. Features so identified are reviewed photogrammetrically every four years and updated as necessary.

FeaturesCaptured (same as for building footprints)
All buildings &gt;400 sq. feet and taller than 12 feet.  Buildings with &lt;12 feet height but with BIN should be captured.&lt;br&gt;Buildings with BIN but &lt;400 sq. feet will be captured.&lt;br&gt;Buildings with flat roofs will be captured on roof outline, capturing the largest outline (excluding overhangs, awnings, construction features, etc.).&lt;br&gt;Buildings with pitched roofs will be captured on the building footprint.&lt;br&gt;Carports, when attached to main building, will be included in the outline. &lt;br&gt;In cases where editors have no visual or plan information to digitize a footprint, a triangle symbol is used. These features are flagged as FEATURE_CODE = Placeholder.

FeaturesExcluded (same as for building footprints)
Do not collect interior divisions (use existing building layer and BIN as guide).&lt;br&gt;Do not collect temporary trailers or tents. Do NOT collect roofs (overhang) to gas stations, unless connected to building.&lt;br&gt;Do NOT collect movable jet bridge for access to aircraft.&lt;br&gt;Do NOT collect awnings, scaffolds, or sidewalk sheds.&lt;br&gt;Do NOT collect small tool or storage sheds in backyards which have no visible car access.  In cases where there is no BIN for a feature, a dummy BIN (1000000, 2000000, etc. for each of the Boroughs, see LION manuals pdf) will be populated until we can determine an actual BIN for the structure.

CaptureUpdateNotes (same as for building footprints)
Guidelines for Photogrammetric Update: Use parcel data and BIN as guidance for collection.  Where the parcel data indicates that a building should be two or more geometries AND there is NO physical indication, split the building using the parcel lines.   Where the parcel data indicates that a building should be two or more geometries AND there is a physical indication, split the building using the physical indications.  In cases where geometry previously existed in the legacy data, populate all resulting geometries with the original BIN (BINs will be duplicated in these cases).&lt;br&gt;Use Parcel layer to place garages within parcel or at parcel boundary  check for special cases where parcel boundary clearly crosses garage.  In these cases, either split the garage using physical features, or use the property line where there is no distinguishing physical feature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For more information on capture and update of the Building Footprints dataset, see (Capture Rules.) [https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md]
Guidelines for Manual Update: Features captured by manual update are digitized from the most recent aerial imagery available. In cases where no imagery is available, features are digitized using plan diagrams available from Dept. of Buildings. In cases where there is no imagery or plan source available, a triangle is added and FEAT_CODE is set to Placeholder. Ground elevations are taken from neighboring buildings or from nearby planimetric spot elevation point features. Roof heights are taken from Dept. of Buildings plan diagrams if available or measured from controlled terrestrial image sources. If no source is available, roof height is left zero or NULL.

All the NYCMap data was aerotriangulated and stereo-compiled to meet ASPRS Class 1 horizontal mapping standards and ASPRS vertical Class 2 accuracy specifications.  The mapping standards deal with Root Mean Square (RMS) calculations that states if a random number of clearly identifiable surveyed ground control points throughout the project were compared to the mapped features, the RMS of the points would not exceed 2'. In layman's terms,  95% of the data is accurate to +/- 2'.
